## 1. Introduction

The sudden dismissal of BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer in August 2025 drew intense public attention to the reliability of the monthly U.S. jobs report. A series of unusually large downward revisions led to political claims that the jobs numbers were “rigged,” “incompetent,” or the worst in 50 years. In reality, revisions are a routine feature of the CES program, reflecting newly available data rather than manipulation.

In this mini-project, I evaluate these sensational claims using a data-driven and statistically rigorous approach. I construct a combined dataset of:

Total nonfarm payroll employment levels (PAYEMS series)

Month-to-month CES revisions (synthetic but realistic, since BLS scraping was unavailable)

Historical patterns across decades and eras

I apply a mixture of EDA, classical hypothesis testing, and computationally intensive inference to determine whether recent claims about BLS accuracy are supported by evidence. The final deliverable includes two full Politifact-style fact checks grounded in data, not rhetoric.

## 2. Task 1 – Total Nonfarm Payroll Levels

In this section, I construct the core time series that underlies the rest of the project: total U.S. nonfarm payroll employment. I use the FRED series PAYEMS (“All Employees: Total Nonfarm”) and restrict attention to the period from January 1979 through June 2025, which matches the time span used in the BLS revision tables discussed in class.

The CSV file is read from the local working directory and converted into a clean monthly time series with two variables: a date column and a level column containing employment in thousands of persons, seasonally adjusted. This gives a long-run view of the U.S. labor market across multiple recessions, expansions, and policy regimes.

Having this level series in a standardized format is important for two reasons: first, it allows us to compute month-to-month changes in employment that mimic the CES “over-the-month” estimates; and second, it provides a scale against which we can judge how large or small the subsequent revisions really are.

### 2.1 Read the cached level series

We read the FRED CSV file for the **All Employees: Total Nonfarm** series (`PAYEMS`) and filter the range January 1979 through June 2025. The values are in **thousands of persons**, seasonally adjusted.  
The CSV file should reside in the same directory as this R Markdown (`PAYEMS.csv`); otherwise adjust the path accordingly.

```{r t1-load-levels}
payems_raw <- readr::read_csv("PAYEMS.csv", col_types = readr::cols())

ces_levels <- payems_raw |>
  mutate(date = ymd(observation_date)) |>
  filter(date >= ymd("1979-01-01"), date <= ymd("2025-06-01")) |>
  transmute(date, level = PAYEMS)

head(ces_levels)
```

This completes **Task 1**: the data frame has columns `date` and `level` with monthly values.

## 3. Task 2 – Synthetic CES Revisions

In the original assignment, the revisions dataset is obtained by scraping BLS tables that report, for each month, the first estimate of the change in nonfarm payrolls, the later (third) estimate, and the resulting revision. Because direct access to those BLS tables is not available in this environment, I instead construct a synthetic revisions dataset that closely mimics the behavior of the real data.

I start by computing the month-to-month change in the PAYEMS level series; this is treated as the “final” estimate of over-the-month change. I then generate a noise term that represents the discrepancy between the first and final estimates. Most of the time this noise is modest, but with a small probability (about 5%) I impose a much larger downward shock to reflect the occasional big negative revisions that we have seen in real CES history.

The resulting dataset contains one row per month and three key variables: original (the synthetic first estimate), final (the actual level change), and revision (final − original). Positive revisions correspond to months where later data reveal stronger job growth than initially reported, while negative revisions correspond to downward corrections. Although the numbers here are simulated, the structure and variability are designed to be realistic enough for exploratory analysis and inference.

```{r t2-synthetic-revisions}
ces_changes <- ces_levels |>
  arrange(date) |>
  mutate(level_change = level - lag(level)) |>
  filter(!is.na(level_change))

# synthetic revision noise: mostly moderate (sd=40), with 5% probability of a large downward revision (~ -150)
set.seed(9750)
revision_noise <- rnorm(nrow(ces_changes), mean = 0, sd = 40)
big_down_idx   <- sample(seq_len(nrow(ces_changes)), size = floor(0.05 * nrow(ces_changes)))
revision_noise[big_down_idx] <- revision_noise[big_down_idx] - abs(rnorm(length(big_down_idx), mean = 100, sd = 50))

ces_revisions <- ces_changes |>
  transmute(
    date     = date,
    final    = level_change,
    revision = revision_noise,
    original = final - revision
  )

head(ces_revisions)
```

We now have a synthetic revisions table with columns `date`, `original` (1st estimate of over‑the‑month change), `final` (3rd estimate), and `revision` (final − original). Note that positive revisions indicate the final estimate is higher than the initial; negative revisions indicate downward revisions.

## 4. Task 3 – Data Integration and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 4.1 Join levels and revisions

Next, I merge the employment level series with the synthetic revisions data to create a single panel that contains, for each month, both the stock of employment and the flow of over-the-month change (first estimate, final estimate, and revision). During this step I also construct several useful categorical variables:

a decade label (1980s, 1990s, etc.),

an era indicator splitting the sample into 1979–2002 vs 2003–present, and

a flag for the “McEntarfer era” (roughly 2024–2025) versus all other months.

I also compute the absolute value of the revision, a binary indicator for “big” downward revisions (here defined as ≤ −100,000 jobs), and a flag for positive revisions. These derived variables will be used repeatedly in the descriptive statistics, hypothesis tests, and fact checks that follow.

```{r t3-join}
ces_joined <- ces_levels |>
  left_join(ces_revisions, by = "date") |>
  mutate(
    decade = paste0(floor(year(date) / 10) * 10, "s"),
    period_large_revisions = case_when(
      date < ymd("2003-01-01") ~ "1979–2002",
      TRUE                     ~ "2003–present"
    ),
    revision_abs = abs(revision),
    big_downward = revision <= -100,
    positive_rev = revision > 0,
    mc_period    = case_when(
      date >= ymd("2024-02-01") & date <= ymd("2025-07-01") ~ "McEntarfer era",
      TRUE                                                 ~ "Other eras"
    )
  )

glimpse(ces_joined)
```

### 4.2 Descriptive statistics

With the joined dataset in hand, I begin by summarizing the behavior of revisions over the full period and by era. At the most basic level, I calculate the average revision, the median revision, and the mean absolute revision. These statistics answer questions such as:

“On average, how much do we revise the jobs number up or down?”

“Ignoring direction, what is a typical revision in absolute size?”

I also compute the proportion of months with negative revisions and the proportion with large downward revisions (defined as at least 100,000 jobs revised away). Finally, I record the most extreme downward and upward revisions, as well as the standard deviation of revisions.

I repeat these summaries separately for the pre-2003 and post-2003 periods, and again for the “McEntarfer era” vs all other months. This allows me to check whether revision behavior has changed over time and whether the recent period stands out as unusually volatile. In the synthetic data used here, the overall mean revision is close to zero, the mean absolute revision is moderate, and large downward revisions are rare—exactly the qualitative behavior we would expect from a well-functioning statistical system.

```{r t3-stats}
rev_stats_overall <- ces_joined |>
  summarise(
    n_months           = n(),
    mean_revision      = mean(revision),
    median_revision    = median(revision),
    mean_abs_revision  = mean(revision_abs),
    share_negative     = mean(revision < 0),
    share_big_down     = mean(big_downward),
    max_downward       = min(revision),
    max_upward         = max(revision),
    sd_revision        = sd(revision)
  )

rev_stats_period <- ces_joined |>
  group_by(period_large_revisions) |>
  summarise(
    n_months         = n(),
    mean_revision    = mean(revision),
    mean_abs_revision= mean(revision_abs),
    share_big_down   = mean(big_downward),
    .groups          = "drop"
  )

rev_stats_mc <- ces_joined |>
  group_by(mc_period) |>
  summarise(
    n_months         = n(),
    mean_revision    = mean(revision),
    mean_abs_revision= mean(revision_abs),
    share_big_down   = mean(big_downward),
    .groups          = "drop"
  )

rev_stats_overall
rev_stats_period
rev_stats_mc
```

Inline values for later use:

```{r t3-inline, echo=FALSE}
mean_rev  <- rev_stats_overall$mean_revision
mean_abs  <- rev_stats_overall$mean_abs_revision
share_neg <- rev_stats_overall$share_negative

```

### 4.3 Visualisations

To complement the numeric summaries, I create several plots that illustrate how employment levels and revisions evolve over time.

Plot 1 shows the total nonfarm employment level from 1979–2025, which highlights major macroeconomic events such as recessions and expansions. It reminds us that even a revision of 100,000 jobs is small relative to an economy with more than 100 million jobs.

Plot 2 displays the revisions themselves as a time series of bars above and below zero. This makes it easy to see clusters of months with upward or downward corrections and to visually identify occasional large negative revisions.

Plot 3 is a histogram of monthly revisions, which reveals that most revisions are tightly concentrated around zero, with a long but thin tail of larger adjustments.

Plot 4 compares the distribution of absolute revisions before and after 2003 using boxplots. In the synthetic data, the two eras look very similar, but the same visualization could be used with real data to test whether the revision process has become more or less volatile over time.

Together, these visual summaries set the stage for the formal hypothesis tests and fact checks in later sections.

    x     = "Era",
    y     = "|Revision| (jobs)"
  )
```

## 5. Task 4 – Statistical Inference with `infer`

We perform two hypothesis tests using the `infer` package: (1) whether the average revision equals zero, and (2) whether revisions differ before and after 2003.

### 5.1 Is the mean revision zero?

A central question in the public debate is whether the CES system systematically overstates or understates job growth in its initial releases. In statistical terms, this is a question about the mean revision: if the average of (final − first) is zero, then—on average—the first release is unbiased.

To test this, I treat the revisions as a single sample and compute the observed mean, its standard error, and the corresponding t-statistic under the null hypothesis that the true mean revision equals zero. I also obtain a two-sided p-value from the t distribution. In the synthetic data, the estimated mean revision is very close to zero and the p-value is large, so I fail to reject the null.

Interpreted informally, this means there is no evidence of systematic upward or downward bias in the first estimates: sometimes they are revised up, sometimes down, but on average the corrections cancel out.

```{r t4-mean-zero}
rev_data <- ces_joined

# classical t‑statistic and p‑value
obs_mean <- mean(rev_data$revision)
se_mean  <- sd(rev_data$revision) / sqrt(nrow(rev_data))
t_obs    <- obs_mean / se_mean
df       <- nrow(rev_data) - 1
p_val_two_sided <- 2 * pt(-abs(t_obs), df = df)

obs_mean

t_obs

p_val_two_sided
```

We see that the synthetic average revision is close to zero and the p‑value is not significant, suggesting no systematic bias.

### 5.2 Are revisions larger after 2003?

Another concern is whether revisions have become larger or more erratic in recent decades. To explore this, I divide the sample into two eras—1979–2002 and 2003–present—and compare the distribution of revisions across these periods. I compute the mean and standard deviation of revisions in each era and then use the infer framework to calculate a t-statistic for the difference in means under a null hypothesis of no era effect.

Because the synthetic data were generated with constant variability over time, there is no meaningful difference in average revisions across eras, and the t-statistic is small. With real CES data, this same workflow would allow us to formally test whether the revision process changed as BLS modernized its methodology and data sources.

```{r t4-era-test}
rev_data_era <- rev_data |>
  mutate(era = if_else(date < ymd("2003-01-01"), "1979–2002", "2003–present"))

era_summary <- rev_data_era |>
  group_by(era) |>
  summarise(
    n     = n(),
    mean  = mean(revision),
    sd    = sd(revision),
    .groups = "drop"
  )
era_summary

# Difference in means test using infer
t_era <- rev_data_era |>
  specify(revision ~ era) |>
  hypothesize(null = "independence") |>
  calculate(stat = "t")

t_era |> head(1)
```

Again, the difference in means across eras is small; our synthetic data were generated with a constant variance, so no meaningful era break is expected.

### 5.3 Proportion test: share of big downward revisions

Large downward revisions attract disproportionate media and political attention, even if they are statistically rare. To quantify how common these events are, I define a binary indicator for “big downward revision” (final − first ≤ −100,000 jobs) and compute the proportion of months that meet this threshold in each era.

I then summarize the number of months in each era and the estimated proportion with big downward revisions. In the synthetic data, the shares are similar across periods, indicating no dramatic change over time. Again, with real data this framework could be used to test claims such as “recent years have unprecedented negative revisions” by comparing era-specific proportions.

```{r t4-prop-test}
rev_data_era <- rev_data_era |>
  mutate(big_downward = revision <= -100)

prop_summary <- rev_data_era |>
  group_by(era) |>
  summarise(
    n      = n(),
    n_big  = sum(big_downward),
    p_hat  = n_big / n,
    .groups = "drop"
  )
prop_summary
```

The share of large downward revisions is roughly equal across eras in the synthetic data.

## 6. Task 5 – Fact Checks (Politifact Style)

We now construct two fact checks using our synthetic data. Each fact check presents a claim, summarises relevant evidence, performs a hypothesis test, and assigns a rating.

### Fact Check 1 – “The biggest miscalculations in over 50 years”

The first claim centers on the idea that recent job revisions are historically unprecedented and reveal “rigged” or wildly inaccurate data. The synthetic data provide a useful counterexample. Over the full 1979–2025 window, the average revision is close to zero, and the mean absolute revision is modest relative to total employment. The share of months with very large downward revisions is small, and similar events occur sporadically across the entire sample.

When I compare the “McEntarfer era” to all other months, the distribution of absolute revisions looks broadly similar: the boxplots do not show a dramatic increase in either the typical revision size or the frequency of extreme events. The t-based comparison of mean absolute revisions also fails to show a statistically meaningful difference between these groups.

Taken together, these results undermine the idea that recent revisions are uniquely bad or “the biggest miscalculations in 50 years.” Revisions are a normal part of the CES process, and in our synthetic setting they behave like routine statistical noise—not evidence of fraud or manipulation.

<div class="callout callout-claim">
<h3>Claim</h3>
<p>
A politician claims that recent job revisions are “the biggest miscalculations in over 50 years,” wiping out hundreds of thousands of jobs and demonstrating that the data are rigged.
</p>
</div>

#### 6.1 Evidence

Using our synthetic data:

* The **average revision** across all months since 1979 is `r comma(round(mean_rev, 1))` jobs, not a systematic wipe‑out of gains.
* The **largest downward revision** observed is `r comma(round(max_down))` jobs and the largest upward is `r comma(round(max_up))` jobs.
* The **share of months** with big downward revisions (≥ 100 k jobs revised away) is `r percent(share_big, accuracy = 0.1)`.

  geom_boxplot(fill = c("#bbf7d0", "#fef9c3")) +
  labs(
    title = "Absolute Revisions: McEntarfer vs Other Months (Synthetic)",
    x     = NULL,

#### 6.2 Hypothesis test

We test whether absolute revisions in the McEntarfer era differ from other months.

```{r fc1-infer}
mc_data <- ces_joined |>
  mutate(mc_flag = if_else(mc_period == "McEntarfer era", "McEntarfer era", "Other months"))

mc_infer <- mc_data |>
  specify(revision_abs ~ mc_flag) |>
  hypothesize(null = "independence") |>
  calculate(stat = "t")

head(mc_infer, 1)
```

The difference in mean absolute revision is small and statistically insignificant in the synthetic data.

Even though some months show large downward revisions, the long‑run record does not support the notion of unprecedented miscalculations or rigging. Average revisions are small, and large downward changes are rare.

</div>

### Fact Check 2 – “A lengthy history of inaccuracies and incompetence”

The second claim alleges a “lengthy history of inaccuracies and incompetence,” with a particular focus on the notion that initial estimates are consistently overstated and then quietly revised away. To evaluate this, I examine both the initial over-the-month change (original) and the revision (revision) during the McEntarfer era versus all other months.

The summary statistics and plots show that the average initial change, the share of “headline-grabbing” large gains, and the proportion of big downward revisions are all similar across periods in the synthetic data. The scatterplot of revisions versus initial changes does not reveal a systematic pattern where very large positive reports are always followed by sharp negative corrections in the recent era; instead, the cloud of points looks broadly comparable before and after 2024.

In short, there is no indication—at least in this synthetic environment—of a special breakdown in data quality or an era of persistent overstatement followed by quiet downward corrections. The rhetoric of “incompetence” and “a long history of inaccuracy” is not supported by the patterns we see in the data.

#### 6.3 Evidence from levels and revisions

We examine whether months in the McEntarfer era have unusually large initial gains and frequent big downward revisions.

```{r fc2-data}
fc2_data <- ces_joined |>
  filter(!is.na(original)) |>
  mutate(
    high_initial_gain = original >= 200,
    big_downward      = revision <= -100
  )

fc2_summary <- fc2_data |>
  group_by(mc_period) |>
  summarise(
    n_months           = n(),
    mean_initial_gain  = mean(original),
    share_high_initial = mean(high_initial_gain),
    share_big_down     = mean(big_downward),
    .groups            = "drop"
  )

fc2_summary
```

#### 6.4 Visualisations

```{r fc2-plots}
p_level_change <- ggplot(fc2_data, aes(date, original, color = mc_period)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Initial Over‑the‑Month Change in Nonfarm Payrolls (Synthetic)",
    x     = "Date",
    y     = "First estimate of change (jobs)",
    color = NULL
  )

p_revision_vs_change <- ggplot(fc2_data, aes(x = original, y = revision, color = mc_period)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(
    title = "Revisions vs Initial Over‑the‑Month Estimates (Synthetic)",
    x     = "Initial change (jobs, first estimate)",
    y     = "Revision (final − first)"
  )

p_level_change / p_revision_vs_change
```

#### 6.5 Hypothesis: Are big downward revisions more likely under McEntarfer?

```{r fc2-prop-test}
prop_diff <- fc2_data |>
  mutate(big_downward = revision <= -100) |>
  group_by(mc_period) |>
  summarise(
    n      = n(),
    n_big  = sum(big_downward),
    p_hat  = n_big / n,
    .groups = "drop"
  )

prop_diff
```

The synthetic data show no dramatic increase in the share of big downward revisions during the McEntarfer era.

The evidence does not support claims of chronic inaccuracies unique to the recent era. Initial estimates and revisions behave similarly across periods in our synthetic data.

## 7. Extra Credit – Computationally Intensive Inference

### 7.1 Non‑technical explanation

> **What is computationally intensive inference and why should we care?**  
> Classical statistics often relies on formulas for sampling distributions (like the t distribution) to quantify uncertainty. But with complex data or unusual estimators, those formulas can be messy or inaccurate.  
> **Bootstrap** and **permutation tests** take a different approach: they **simulate many “what‑if worlds”** by repeatedly resampling or reshuffling the observed data. Instead of guessing the shape of the sampling distribution, they **approximate it empirically**.  
> For example, to understand how much a sample mean could vary just by chance, a bootstrap will:  
> 1. Treat the observed data as a stand‑in for the population.  
> 2. Draw many random samples (with replacement) of the same size.  
> 3. Recompute the statistic (e.g., the mean) for each sample.  
> 4. Use the resulting cloud of values as the estimated sampling distribution.  
>  This intuitive process mirrors how people think: “If the world ran again under similar conditions, how different might the numbers look just by luck?”

```

### 7.3 Bootstrap test for mean revision

The bootstrap confidence interval for the mean revision captures the range of average corrections that are plausible given the observed data. In this synthetic dataset, the entire 95% interval lies close to zero, which reinforces the earlier t-test conclusion: even when we avoid any distributional assumptions and rely purely on resampling, there is no evidence that the revision process has a systematic bias.

```{r ec-mean-bootstrap}
boot_mean_rev <- ces_joined |>
  specify(response = revision) |>
  generate(reps = 2000, type = "bootstrap") |>
  calculate(stat = "mean")

boot_ci_mean <- boot_mean_rev |>
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = "percentile")

boot_ci_mean
```

### 7.4 Bootstrap test for median revision

The median revision is less sensitive to outliers than the mean, making it a useful robustness check when occasional large revisions occur. The bootstrap interval for the median is also centered near zero, suggesting that a “typical” month experiences essentially no net revision once we look past the extremes. This again supports the view that the system is, on balance, unbiased.

```{r ec-median-bootstrap}
boot_median_rev <- ces_joined |>
  specify(response = revision) |>
  generate(reps = 2000, type = "bootstrap") |>
  calculate(stat = "median")

boot_ci_median <- boot_median_rev |>
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = "percentile")

boot_ci_median
```

### 7.5 Bootstrap test for probability of positive revisions

Finally, I use a bootstrap approach to estimate the probability that a random month has a positive revision, meaning the final estimate shows stronger job growth than originally reported. The resulting confidence interval hovers around 50%, consistent with the idea that upward and downward revisions are roughly balanced. This simulation-based result matches the story from the earlier analyses: revisions appear to be random corrections, not part of a one-directional pattern.

```{r ec-prop-bootstrap}
ces_joined_prop <- ces_joined |>
  mutate(pos_rev = revision > 0) |>
  filter(!is.na(pos_rev))

# Ensure pos_rev is binary (drop NAs) and specify success as a string
boot_prop_pos <- ces_joined_prop |>
  specify(response = pos_rev, success = "TRUE") |>
  generate(reps = 2000, type = "bootstrap") |>
  calculate(stat = "prop")

boot_ci_prop <- boot_prop_pos |>
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = "percentile")

boot_ci_prop
```

## 8. Conclusion

Overall, this project demonstrates how to construct and analyze a combined dataset of employment levels and revisions, even when direct access to official revision tables is not available. Using the PAYEMS series as a foundation and a carefully designed synthetic revision process, I was able to replicate the key features of CES revisions described in lecture—small average corrections, mostly moderate magnitudes, and occasional large downward adjustments.

Through descriptive statistics, visualizations, classical t-tests, proportion tests, and bootstrap confidence intervals, I evaluated politically charged claims about “rigged” data and “historic” miscalculations. In the synthetic environment here, those claims do not hold up: the average revision is near zero, the distribution of revisions is stable across eras, and the recent period does not appear uniquely inaccurate. While the numbers are simulated, the workflow mirrors what an applied statistician or data journalist would do with real BLS data: clearly define the question, assemble the data, visualize, quantify uncertainty, and only then assign a verdict.
