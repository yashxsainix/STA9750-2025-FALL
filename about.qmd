This website hosts Mini‑Project #01 for STA 9750 — *Processing Netflix Top 10 data* with R, **dplyr**, and **Quarto**.

- The **docs/** folder here is **pre-rendered** so you can publish on GitHub Pages even if Quarto fails locally.
- The **source files** (`mp01.qmd`, `about.qmd`) contain all assignment code; render later when your Quarto environment is clean.
